A beautiful app that will let you know how much sun you have today.

This app uses your device's GPS to determine your location and current date to calculate the length of the day

## What's interesting about this project?

### Uses a JavaScript library for the sun calculation

Shares the same sun calculation library as the web app. It uses JavaScriptCore to load suncalc.js, you can find the library here: https://github.com/mourner/suncalc. The bridge that converts JavaScript to Swift can be found in [SunCalc.swift](https://github.com/bakkenbaeck/daylight-ios/blob/master/Library/SunCalc.swift).
